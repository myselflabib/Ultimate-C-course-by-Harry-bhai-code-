# C Programming Learning Repository

## About This Repository

Welcome to my C programming learning repository! This repository contains my journey of learning the C programming language, including various examples, exercises, and projects.

## About Me

Hi there, I'm Labib! I'm a student and a new learner of programming, and I'm currently diving into the world of C. This repository will document my progress as I explore the fundamentals of C programming and work on different projects.

## Why Learn C?

C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system programming, developing operating systems, and embedded systems. Learning C provides a strong foundation in programming concepts and helps understand how computers work at a lower level.

## Learning Source

I'm currently following the **C Language Tutorial for Beginners** by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZb0iu4uGwA&t=2411s) on YouTube. This course has been incredibly helpful in breaking down complex concepts into easy-to-understand lessons.

## Getting Started

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C to get started:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the above program, follow these steps:

1. Save the code in a file named `hello.c`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.c`.
4. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as `gcc`:

```sh
gcc hello.c -o hello
```

5. Run the compiled program:

```sh
./hello
```

You should see the output:

```
Hello, World!
```
